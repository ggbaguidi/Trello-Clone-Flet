# Trello Clone Flet

## Making a Trello clone with Python and Flet

### Why Flet?

Most developers are undoubtedly familiar with the situation of either having developed a console app that turns out to have a wider audience than originally intended, or needing to develop an internal tool for non-developers but which is destined to have a small user base and/or a relatively brief shelf life. In situations like these it can often feel awkward to reach for an oversized tool such as electron, a feature rich framework like flutter (irony acknowledged!), or try to quickly get a handle on some other cross platform framework like .NET MAUI. What we would really like is to be able to throw a UI on our logic that looks generically decent, has acceptable performance, and ideally, takes less time to write than did the business logic, and preferably in the same language in which the rest of the logic was written - i.e. a language with which we are already proficient (currently the only released library is in Python but C#, Typescript, and Golang libraries are on the roadmap). This is exactly what the Flet platform aims to provide.

Flet takes a different approach to many new UI frameworks that is arguably more intuitive to the majority of experienced programmers. Diverging from the currently ubiquitous declarative approach and opting instead for an imperative model.

Having intimated that Flet is designed with simple GUIs in mind, lets nonetheless try to make something a tad more complicated than, for example, a simple dashboard with some filters, and shoot for something like a minimal version of Trello - and bestow upon it the totally-independently-arrived-at-name, Trolli. For the purposes of this tutorial I'll assume the reader is familiar with the basic concept and setup of a Flet project (read the tutorials and the docs if not), and instead focus more on aspects that are not part of the existing tutorials.
